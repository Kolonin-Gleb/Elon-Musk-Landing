            Elon Musk's parents, Errol Musk and May Mask married in 1970. <br>
            They have three childreen: Elon, Kimball and Tosca Musk. <br>
            Three years later they got divorced and the children stayed with their father. <br> <br>

            Elon Musk was bullied in school, so he prefered to study alone. <br>
            <b>When he was 12, he sold a computer game of his own design Blastar for 500$.</b> <br>
            The earned money he invested in the pharmatiutical companies. <br>
            He later sold his stocks and bought a ticket to Canada <br>
            <b>against father's solution</b> and immigrated there. <br> <br>

            His mother was born in Canada, so he got Canadian citizenship. <br>
            Elon made this step, because he didn't want to serve <br>
            in the army of South Africa and because he knew that <br>
            the best technologies are often originate in the North America. <br>

            It is important to say, that Elon's escape <br> 
            from South Africa wasn't well planned. <br>
            All that Elon knew was that he had great uncle in Montreal. <br>
            <u>So he got on a plane and relied on luck.</u> <br> <br>

            After the plane landed he tried to find his great <br>
            uncle using help desk, but unsucessfully. <br>
            It turned out that his great uncle had moved to Minnesota <br>
            and Elon had no place to stay! <br> <br>
            
            After this horrible start Elon Musk spent <br>
            several days in a nearby hostel thinking what to do. <br>
            Finally, <b>he travelled 3000km by bus</b> <br>
            to a small city Swift Current, where his second cousin lived. <br> <br>
            
            Throughout out the 1989 he worked on different "survival jobs". <br> <br>
            
            In 1990, when Elon Musk was 19 years old, he was enrolled at <br>
            <i>Queen's University at Kingston</i>. <br>
            That's where he studied for 2 years until 1992. <br>

            He flew to the USA and transferred from <i>Queen's University at Kingston</i> <br>
            to the <i>University of Pennsylvania.</i> <br>
            He was given a scholarship in it. <br>
            Elon also graduated with bachelor's degrees in economics and applied physics there.

            In 1995 at the age of 25, he entered <i>Standford university</i> <br>
            to obtain a doctoral degree in applied physics and materials science. <br> <br>

            However after a few days he left it, because <br>
            he decided to take part in internet boom, <br>
            launching <b>his first start-up Zip2 Corporation.</b> <br>

            While developing Zip2 Elon Musk and his brother Cimball <br>
            rented an office, where they were living and working. <br>
            They had one computer, so Elon was working during the nights <br>
            while his brother was working during the days. <br>
            To have a shower they went to a gym nearby. <br> <br>

            Their hard work was rewarded. The project was a huge success. <br>
            In 1999 Compaq bought Zip2 for <b>$307 million</b>. <br>
            <u>At the early age of 20 years Elon became a multimillionaire</u>. <br>

            The money he earned were invested at Elon's new start-up - X.com, <br>

            A year later in 2000, it merged with Confinity (Peter Till's company) <br>
            and became the famous PayPal. <br> <br>

            but no one believed in his private space company. <br>
            So he became its CTO and took part in developing rockets himself. <br> <br>

            After some successful launches in december of 2008 <br>
            NASA signed contract a contract with SpaceX. <br>
